<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

<span>**Research Interest**</span>

My research interest mainly focuses on Computer Vision (CV) issues under various learning scenarios. I am especially interested in problems involving multiple domains, agents or tasks. 

Currently, I am researching Deepfake issues from learning perspective. Before that, I also worked on Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and Federated Learning (FL) issues.
I am always welcome to research cooperation! So, if you are interested, feel free to contact me via email.
